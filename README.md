## Deployment Instructions ON neotic

1. **Start the Gazebo Simulation**

   Launch the Gazebo simulation for the MRobot using the following command:

   ```bash 
   roslaunch mrobot_gazebo sim_bringup.launch
   ```
   
This command will initiate the Gazebo simulation environment. Ensure that the Gazebo simulator is properly installed and set up before running this command.

2. **Launch the Move Demo Server**

   After successfully starting the Gazebo simulation, the next step is to launch the Move Demo Server. Use the command below:
   
       roslaunch move_demo start_server.launch
   This command will start the Move Demo server, a critical component for controlling the MRobot's movements within the simulation.

3. **Launch the Move Demo Server**
   Run the Robot Teleoperation Script
   
   Finally, to control the MRobot within the Gazebo simulation, run the robot teleoperation script as follows:
   
       rosrun move_demo robot_teleop.py
   This command will start a Python script that allows for teleoperation of the MRobot within the simulation.
